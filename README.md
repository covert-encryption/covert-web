We are combining forces with the excellent [hat.sh](https://hat.sh/) encryption tool already based on similar technologies as Covert, to provide a next generation encryption application that can run entirely in browser, never exposing your data or keys to any server.

The webapp is currently in such early phase of development that it cannot be used but the main project [Covert](https://github.com/covert-encryption/covert) can already be tried. Any help in development of this as well as the Python and C versions is highly welcome. We intend to finish all versions on the first half of 2022.
